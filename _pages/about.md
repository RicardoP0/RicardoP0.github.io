I am a PhD student at the [Robotics and eSafety Research Group](https://www.robesafe.uah.es/index.php/en/) at the University of Alcal√°, Spain. My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and HMI. Currently, I am focused on developing vision models for distracted driver activity classification. I am working under the guidance of [Prof. Luis M. Bergasa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uEBILewAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Luis Baumela](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HQsRT00AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
